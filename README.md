## Optimizations

The final product will provide the ability for users to research herbs based on a variety of search functions, create an account to save specific herbs or categories, and submit additions to the collection. 

Planned optimizations: 
1. Update post categories to include a more detailed breakdown of the plant and its properties. (updating schemas)
2. Look into providing more user friendly settings, such as changing a password, updating personal information, adding a profile image, etc. 
3. Update index to include a search function so users are not required to make an account to access the database.
4. Update user profiles with the ability to create lists and save specific posts to their chosen list.
